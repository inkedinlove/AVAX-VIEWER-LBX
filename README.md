Avalanche Viewer by LOCKB0X LLC

Overview

Welcome to the LOCKB0X Avalanche Viewer, a decentralized application designed to enable secure decryption and viewing of files and contextual receipts tied to Avalanche transactions. Our platform leverages Avalanche’s high-performance infrastructure to empower users with immutable, encrypted records across various use cases, such as construction control, financial audit trails, medical records, legal contracts, and more.

The Dapp Viewer ensures that users can decrypt, view, and download encrypted files tied to their Avalanche wallet without reliance on centralized platforms.

Features

•	Decrypt & View Encrypted Files: Access your encrypted files directly from IPFS, Filecoin, or Arweave using your Avalanche wallet.
  
•	Contextual Receipts: View encrypted metadata and receipts for full context and traceability in your on-chain interactions.

•	Interoperability: Supports a wide range of file formats (PDF, JPEG, PNG, MP4, GLTF, etc.).

•	Decentralized & Secure: Built on Avalanche, ensuring a fully decentralized approach to document encryption, storage and access.

Getting Started

Coming Soon

The LOCKB0X Avalanche Dapp Viewer is currently under development, with a public release expected by the end of 2024. At that time, we will provide full installation instructions and access to the source code.
